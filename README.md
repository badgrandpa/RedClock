 I  took inspiration in a Sand Clock and how plesent and mesmerizing it 
 is to watch the tiny grians of sand trickle away. I wanted to create a 
 vizual piece that slowly generated and decomposed itself. enticing people
 to look at each curve progress just like you would a sand clock.
 
 In this particular Clock I used the first bezier for seconds, the second 
 for minutes and then a slow moving rectangle for hours. I also added an
 ADD blendmode and BLUR (new favorite thing) to investigate color variation 
 and experiment with the color pallet and how it affected the overall piece
 as it moved.
